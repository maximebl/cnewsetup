# cnewsetup
Directx12 template project using Clang and C99

# Serves as an example on how to:
* Setup Dear ImGui 1.74 https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
* How to do code hot reloading
* How to use query timers in DirectX 12
* How to get around certain bugs in the DX12 C bindings
* How to use c99 designated initializers for more readable DX12 code 



# Disclaimers
* Make sure you're in developer mode before running `build_debug.ps1`.
* I'm not sure what's the best way to handle all the windows dependencies without requiring the user of this project to have visual studio installed. So I put all the dependencies in `cnewstup\bin\dependencies`.
